Over time, the organization adapts by either hiding problems until\nthey explode or bypassing the leader to get real truth discussed elsewhere.",

    "whatToDo": "• Run a weekly closure review: what moved from yellow to green, what is stuck, and the next action.\n• Ask for one piece of candid feedback each week (what should I start/stop/continue) and act on one item.\n• Define and publish three priorities for the next 7 days with owners and what good looks like.\n• Protect focus: remove one low-value meeting/task this week to create capacity for leadership behaviors.\n• Share your plan: tell the team what you are changing, how you will track it, and when you will review it.",

    "counterQuestions": "• What patterns have repeated despite multiple fixes?\n• What decision am I delaying because it’s uncomfortable?\n• What am I holding that someone else could learn by owning?\n• What commitment did I make that I haven’t closed the loop on?\n• When was the last time I connected this work to purpose?"
